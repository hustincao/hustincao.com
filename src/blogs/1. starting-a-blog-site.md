> TL;DR: This blog was built with Astro

# Welcome!

Hey there! I'm kicking off this dev blog to document my projects, share lessons, and write about web development as I learn and build. Naturally, the first post had to be about building this blog itself.

Astro caught my attention for a few reasons:

- Static site generation by default — perfect for a blog.
- Zero JS by default — super fast page loads.
- Content-focused — Astro’s MDX and content collections make it easy to organize blogs.

## Styling + Customization

For styles, I kept it simple with Tailwind. Astro has a great integration for it, and I didn’t need much. To be honest, I don't even need Tailwind for the style that I'm going for.

## Writing Posts

Writing posts in Markdown is super smooth. The <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#what-are-content-collections">content collection</a> makes it really easy to write blog posts and push them up onto a server using static site generation.

## What's Next

I'll be making minor UI updates to the website occasionally. Now that the site is live, I'm planning to post regularly about:

- Web dev experiments
- Side projects
- Tools I love (or hate)
